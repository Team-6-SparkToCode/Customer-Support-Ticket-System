# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🔧 How to Switch User Roles

1. **Login Page**: Use the role dropdown to select different user types
2. **Demo Accounts**:
   - Customer: `john@customer.com`
   - Staff: `sarah@company.com` or `mike@company.com`
   - Admin: `admin@company.com`
   - Password for all accounts: `password`

3. **Testing Different Flows**:
   - Log in as Customer to create and track tickets
   - Switch to Staff to manage tickets and assign priorities
   - Use Admin account to configure system settings

## 📊 Mock Data

The system includes comprehensive seed data:
- **3 Categories**: Technical Issue, Billing, General Inquiry
- **4 Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- **4 Demo Users**: 1 Customer, 2 Staff, 1 Admin
- **12+ Sample Tickets** with threaded conversations
- **Realistic Timestamps** and status progression

## 🔄 Status Workflow

Tickets follow a strict status progression:
1. **Open** → New tickets start here
2. **In Progress** → Staff actively working
3. **Resolved** → Issue fixed, awaiting customer confirmation
4. **Closed** → Fully resolved and archived

The StatusStepper component visually represents this progression and prevents invalid status transitions.

## 🔒 Security Features

- Client-side route protection
- Role-based component rendering
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- XSS protection through proper React practices
- CSRF protection simulation in MSW handlers

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- Adaptive layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for screens from 320px to 1920px+

## 🎯 Production Readiness

While this is a frontend-only demo, it includes production-level features:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Optimistic updates with query invalidation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)
- SEO-friendly structure
- Performance optimization with code splitting

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is ready for deployment to any static hosting service:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront

Simply run `npm run build` and deploy the `dist` folder.
